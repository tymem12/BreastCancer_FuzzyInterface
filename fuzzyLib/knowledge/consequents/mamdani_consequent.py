class MamdaniConsequent(Consequent):

    Class used to represent a fuzzy rule consequent in Mamdani model:
    Basically it is a clause but as the result of our rule
    http://researchhubs.com/post/engineering/fuzzy-system/mamdani-fuzzy-model.html

    Attributes
    --------------------------------------------
    __clause : Clause
        supplies Consequent with universe and a fuzzy set

    __cut_clause : Clause
        Clause with fuzzy set cut to the rule firing level

    Methods
    --------------------------------------------
    output(rule_firing: MembershipDegree) -> Clause
        Clause with fuzzy set cut to the rule firing level

    Examples:
    --------------------------------------------
    Creating decision variable
    >>> watering = LinguisticVariable('watering', Domain(0, 1, 0.001))
    Creating fuzzy set for watering
    >>> watering_low = Type1FuzzySet(gaussian(0.5, 0.1))
    Creating clause: watering is low
    >>> watering_low_clause = Clause(watering, 'Low', watering_low)
    Creating MamdaniConsequent
    >>> watering_low_consequent = MamdaniConsequent(watering_low_clause)
    Cutting membership function of low watering to firing level of rule
    >>> firing = 0.3
    >>> cut_clause = watering_low_consequent.output(firing)
